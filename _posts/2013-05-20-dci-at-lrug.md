Data Context Interaction is a recently invented programming paradigm aiming to separate behaviour from your data model. By extracting interactions into roles, they can be played by objects in various contexts.

I recently gave a talk about DCI at the London Ruby User Group ([LRUG](http://lrug.org)). The presentation gave a brief introduction to DCI, proposed ways to implement role injection, and discussed how DCI could be used to supplement the Rails MVC paradigm.
